# Basic-Blackjack

## Description
This Python program allows you to play a classic game of Blackjack in the terminal. The game is played between the user and the computer, where the objective is to have a hand value closest to 21 without exceeding it. A Blackjack (an Ace and a 10-value card) is a special case that wins instantly.

## Gameplay:

  - When prompted, type 'y' to start a new game or 'n' to exit.
  - During the game, type 'y' to draw another card or 'n' to hold and end your turn.
  - The game will display the hands and scores of both the player and the computer in the end.
